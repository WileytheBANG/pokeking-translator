🎯 Project Overview
Pokeking Translator is a lightweight tool designed to improve raw translations from Google Translate. Its purpose is twofold:

Refine rough translations to make them clearer and closer to the intended meaning.

Extract and summarize the core solution provided on the original website, ensuring users get the essential idea quickly.

This is especially useful for parsing complex or technical content from foreign sources.
